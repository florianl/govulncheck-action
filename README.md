# govulncheck-action

This is yet another action using [govulncheck](https://go.dev/blog/vuln) to identify vulnerabilities
in your Go code.It checks the code against known vulnerabilities published in
[pkg.go.dev/vuln](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/).

## Usage

```yaml
name: "Vulnerability scan"

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ '**' ]

jobs:
  ci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        fetch-depth: 1
    - uses: florianl/govulncheck-action@latest
```

A more advanced example that includes call stacks and provides a JSON output might look like this:
```yaml
name: "Vulnerability scan"

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ '**' ]

jobs:
  ci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        fetch-depth: 1
    - uses: florianl/govulncheck-action@latest
      with:
        govulncheck-json: true
        govulncheck-verbose: true
```
